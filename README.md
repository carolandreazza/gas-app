<h2>Motivation</h2>

The intention of this app was to demonstrate how the gas control of a house would work, where when turning on the heater, for example, time starts to run and adds up to the total amount.
It made to complement a friend's college assignment. So the calculations are not correct.

<h2>Usage</h2>

- Clone this repository
- Run command: ```expo init```
